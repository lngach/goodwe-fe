                                The BT series is a GoodWe retrofit AC-coupled solution, which can upgrade existing three-phase PV system to store energy ranges of 5KW, 6KW, 8KW & 10KW. This solution can modernize any three-phase PV system, providing the ability to store power or operate with the back-up of batteries, ensuring interactivity or grid independence. It is compatible with high voltage Li-Ion batteries ranging from 180 to 600V and it is also equipped with the UPS-Level Switching. It can reach a high efficiency of up to 97.5%. It includes a Battery Input Reverse Polarity Protection as part of its set of protections and it also includes LAN as one of its communications options.

                                GoodWe cares about your safety. Storage is much more complicated than an on-grid system, so the BH Series is designed with battery input reverse polarity protection which works by switching off the inverter immediately when a fault is detected. This protects the battery and avoids an electric shock at the same time.
